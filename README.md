# *Fusion-model-implementation*

This is a test state-of-the-art transformer model equipped with multi-grouped-query-attention and feedforward and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
using pytorch and zeta...




The Fusion model is a custom transformer-based architecture designed for sequence modeling tasks. It incorporates several advanced components including:

Multi-Query Attention: An efficient attention mechanism that allows multiple attention heads to query the same key-value pairs.
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH): A method to efficiently approximate nearest neighbors search.
FeedForward Layers: Used to increase the model capacity by adding non-linear transformations.
Positional Embedding: Added to the input embeddings to retain the positional information.


it kind of resonates with the LLAMma model, This design is reminiscent of the attention mechanisms used in models like LLAMA, which also leverage multiple attention heads to capture diverse aspects of the input data.

You can use this model and train on your archived datasets, and the responses would be kind of like LLAMA based...
